### Option 2: Installing a non-editable package from GitHub **[Already Available]**

To install the mantisshrimp package from its GitHub repo, run the command here below. This option can be used in Google Colab,
for example, where you might install the mantisshrimp latest version (from the `master` branch)

```bash

### Option 3: Installing an editable package from GitHub **[Already Available]**
> **Note:** This method is used by developers who are usually either:
>
> - actively contributing to `mantisshrimp` project by adding new features or fixing bugs, or 
> - creating their own modules, and making sure that their source code stay in sync with the `mantisshrimp` latest version.

All we have to do is to follow these 3 simple steps by running the following commands:
